# Biotech Intelligence Platform
An end to end machine learning system that helps researchers discover relevant biotech papers,
companies and funding opportunities using multi-agent RAG architecture

# Project Vision
This platform demonstrates production-grade ML engineering by combining modern AI/ML technologies into a
comprehensive system for biotech research intelligence. It showcases expertise in 
* Multi-agent orchestration using LangGraph.
* RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) at scale.
* Full-stack ML engineering from data pipelines to deployment.
* MLOps best practices with monitoring and observability.

# Key Features

## Intelligent Agent System

* Research Agent : Literature search and synthesis acoss Pubmed, ArXiv and bioRxiv.
* Company Intelligence Agent: Competitve analysis and market insights.
* Funding Agent: Grant discovery and VC tracking.
* Clinical Trials Agent: Trial Status monitoring and outcome analysis.
* Patent Agent: IP landscape and freedom-to-operate analysis.

# Advanced Search Capabilities

* Semantic search using sentence-transformers.
* Hybrid Search.
* Entity extracton (proteins, drugs, companies, researchers)
* Knowledge graph for relationship discovery.
* Multi-document synthesis and report generation.

# Production Architecture
* Microservices design with FastAPI.
* Scalable data pipelines with Apache Airflow.
* Vector database for embeddings.
* Graph database (Neo4j) for entity relationships.
* Redis caching for perormance optimization.
* Comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
  
# Quick Start
## Prerequisite
* Python 3.11+
* Docker & Docker Compose
* Poetry (dependency managemnt)
